# Python

## Running

This application uses Python **3**, with no additional libraries.

The program can be run one of two ways:

`python group_proj.py`

`python group_proj.py <path to instructions>`

Running it with no additional arguments will cause it to prompt you for the location later.

The program will print out the ASCII art accordingly!
